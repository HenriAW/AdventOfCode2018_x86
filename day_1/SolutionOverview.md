# Day 1 solution overview
## Part 1
This is a nice one to start out with! I need to write some functions that do basic operations that will be used in each challenge, so this is a great since that basically covers everything!
My plan for completing this is to:
1. Read the contents of a file into memory given a filepath
2. Loop through the data, splitting by new line
3. Convert the ascii string into an int
